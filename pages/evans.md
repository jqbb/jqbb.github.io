# Title

Multilevel Models of Intersectional Inequalities 

# Abstract

How can we incorporate intersectional thinking into our research, evaluation, and promotion of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion? 
Intersectional MAIHDA (multilevel analysis of individual heterogeneity and discriminatory accuracy) is a quantitative method recently developed in the field of social epidemiology (Evans et al. 2018). It has been hailed as the “new gold standard for investigating health disparities” (Merlo 2018). Intersectional MAIHDA is a tool for engaging in inclusive, justice-focused research and practice, with potential applications across the social and population health sciences. Empirical and simulation studies have shown MAIHDA has numerous methodological and theoretical advantages over conventional methods, such as regression models with high-dimensional interaction parameters (Bell et al 2019, Mahandran et al 2022a, 2022b, Evans et al. 2020). At its heart, MAIHDA is a reimagining of multilevel (hierarchical) models for a new purpose: quantitative intersectional analysis. In this session, I will introduce intersectional MAIHDA, explore examples to showcase its potential, and address practical issues to help you consider whether it would be useful in your own work.
