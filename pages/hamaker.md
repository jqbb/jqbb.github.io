Dr. Ellen Hamaker\\
Professor of Longitudinal Data Analysis\\
Utrecht University

Dr. Ellen Hamaker is Professor of Longitudinal Data Analysis at Utrecht University. Dr. Hamaker’s work focuses on developing statistical models to improve the field of panel research, which is based on data that consist of a relatively small number of repeated measures (i.e., typically T < 8), as well as the field of intensive longitudinal research, which is based on data that consist of a large number of repeated measures (i.e., say T > 20). Her most important contributions to these fields are the Random Intercept Cross-Lagged Panel Model (RI-CLPM) that was proposed as an alternative for the popular Cross-Lagged Panel Model (Hamaker, Kuiper & Grasman, 2015), and Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling (DSEM), which is a flexible toolbox in the software package Mplus which she helped to develop, and that can be used to analyse intensive longitudinal data (Asparouhov, Hamaker & Muthén, 2018). A recurrent theme in Dr. Hamaker’s work is the importance of separating within-person dynamics from stable between-person differences. In addition, Dr. Hamakers focuses on how insights from modern causality literature can be put to use in social and behavioural sciences.  

# Title

Reflections on the Within-Between Dispute in Cross-Lagged Panel Research

# Abstract

Cross-lagged panel data, involving the observation of two or more variables at multiple points in time within the same cases (e.g., individuals or dyads), provide unique opportunities to examine temporal stability and change. Recently, there has been a growing interest in various statistical models that dissect the observed variability in such data, distinguishing between stable between-person characteristics and temporal within-person fluctuations. While some researchers in the field of psychology enthusiastically endorse this approach as the right path forward, others have been more hesitant or sometimes even dismissive of these developments. In this presentation, I will examine the within-between distinction in panel research from three different angles: design, data, and research question. This exploration will underscore the importance of considering the timescale at which a process unfolds and how this relates to the study design and the stability patterns in the data.
