# Title

Panel on Teaching for Diversity in Quantitative Courses

# Abstract

In our increasingly diverse and multicultural society, itâ€™s more important than ever for teachers to incorporate culturally responsive instruction in the classroom. Quantitative methodology instructors have a unique opportunity to incorporate instruction that focuses on Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI). The three invited panel speakers have incorporated DEI in their teaching activities and will discuss ways to engage students in conversations around issues concerning DEI.
