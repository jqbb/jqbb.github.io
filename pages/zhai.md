# Title

AI and Formative Assessment: The Train Has Left the Station

# Abstract

Researchers have been questioning AI --whether we can and should use AI for formative assessment. AI is already being employed, for better or worse, to facilitate formative assessment in various educational contexts. In this talk, Dr. Zhai will demonstrate research on AI-based assessment in science education. He will respond to the many concerns raised in the field regarding AI being used for formative assessment practices. He argues that the focus of research should be on how we can help educators manage an AI revolution that has outpaced a research community caught unaware and recognize the remarkable progress that AI has contributed to formative assessment.
