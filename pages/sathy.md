# Title

Using a Quantitative Mindset to Advance DEI in Higher Ed

# Abstract

This session will illustrate systems-level approaches to advance equity and inclusion in undergraduate education using a quantitative mindset. Drawing upon our leadership experiences in the Office of Undergraduate Education at UNC-Chapel Hill, we will share some of the innovative projects we've undertaken to promote equity in student success. First, we will share projects we have undertaken to increase student engagement and learning for all our students. Next, we will discuss programmatic efforts to support faculty in their teaching and scholarship of teaching, as well as administrators in monitoring efforts to help students succeed. Finally, we will share some research projects we are currently undertaking to advance the scholarship of inclusive teaching and provide evidence of the educational benefits of diversity.
