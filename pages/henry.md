# Title

"How can constructs be real if our eyes aren't real?": A modest proposal for psychological construct theory.

# Abstract

Since Cronbach & Meehl's seminal 1955 paper, psychologists, psychometricians and philosophers have been arguing incessantly about the nature of psychological constructs. In this talk, I will add yet another argument to the pile: that constructs are real, just not in the way that realists want, that constructs and measurements are not useful to separate, and that the validity of a construct depends entirely on its use case. To lay this argument out I will use recent work on construct theory in addition to more classical work on the philosophy of psychological science. Finally, I will illustrate the differences between the realist and proposed instrumentalist stance by discussing the construct theory behind two modern psychological theories, the p-factor theory and the theory of constructed emotion.
