# Welcome!

<p>The joint quantitative brownbag (joint QBB) speaker series
started out as an initiative between two graduate quantitative methods programs
during the start of COVID-19 in Fall 2020. Currently, this initiative has grown
to include about half a dozen quantitative methods graduate programs across
North America. The longstanding <b>purpose</b> of the joint brownbag is to <b>facilitate
connection and discussion among students and faculty in graduate programs on
topics of interest to a breadth of research topics in quantitative methodology</b>.
Quantitative methodologists develop theory, methods, and techniques focused on
enhancing research in the social and behavioral sciences.</p>

<p>We meet monthly during the academic Fall and Spring
semesters to feature experts in different fields from quantitative methods. Our
meetings are over zoom and held on <b>Mondays from 12:30-1:30pm ET</b>.</p>
