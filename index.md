<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>The joint quantitative brownbag (joint QBB) speaker series
started out as an initiative between two graduate quantitative methods programs
during the start of COVID-19 in Fall 2020. Currently, this initiative has grown
to include about half a dozen quantitative methods graduate programs across
North America. The longstanding <b>purpose</b> of the joint brownbag is to <b>facilitate
connection and discussion among students and faculty in graduate programs on
topics of interest to a breadth of research topics in quantitative methodology</b>.
Quantitative methodologists develop theory, methods, and techniques focused on
enhancing research in the social and behavioral sciences.</p>

<p>We meet monthly during the academic Fall and Spring
semesters to feature experts in different fields from quantitative methods. Our
meetings are over zoom and held on <b>Mondays from 12:30-1:30pm ET</b>.</p>

### Upcoming talks

<p>Our upcoming talks for Fall 2022 will focus on quantitative
methods and expertise surrounding the <b>theme of diversity, equity, and
inclusion (DEI)</b>.</p>

<p>For Fall 2022, we will meet on the following dates:</p>

<p>12 September 2022</p>

<p>10 October 2022</p>

<p>7 November 2022</p>
